This is a readability calculator library for Python.

You're able to calculate the readability of a text using several algorithms:
 - Flesch-Kincaid
 - Coleman-Liau
 - Dale-Chall
 - KPC (Dutch AVI score)

All available calculators have a min_age property which describes the typical minimum age for a potential reader.
Although the algorithms themselves might not be language independent, they can be called as such using a custom locale. This locale has to be available as a myspell dictionary. By default, the locale is set to 'en_GB'.

fk = FleschKincaid(open('/tmp/text.txt').read(), locale='nl_NL')
dc = DaleChall(open( '/tmp/text.txt' ).read(), simplewordlist=simplewords, locale='de_DE')

print fk.min_age
print dc.min_age
