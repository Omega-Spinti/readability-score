This is a Python AVI calculator

AVI is the Dutch method for determining text difficulty. 
(http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVI_%28onderwijs%29)
This tool can calculate the AVI score of a Dutch text.
Only the old KPC method is implemented for now. The new
CITO method (CILT) isn't very well documented.
